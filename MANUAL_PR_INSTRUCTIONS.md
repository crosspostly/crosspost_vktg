## 📊 Statistics

```
Total changes: 176 lines
- Additions: 151 lines
- Deletions: 25 lines
- Files changed: 1 (client.gs)
- Functions modified: 5
- Functions added: 2
- New features: 3
```

## ⚠️ Server Requirements

Before merging, ensure server.gs implements:
- `get_telegram_chat_name` event handler
- `get_vk_group_name` event handler  
- `format_settings` parameter support in binding events

Without these, the new functions will gracefully degrade (use IDs instead of names).

---

## ✅ Testing Status

- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] All function signatures updated
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Security review passed
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Manual testing required (needs server integration)
- [ ] Integration testing required (full workflow)

---

## 📞 Questions?

If you have questions about the implementation:
1. Check detailed comments in `client.gs`
2. Review `PR_CLIENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` 
3. Check `UNIFIED_TODO.md` for requirements
4. Logs include DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR messages for troubleshooting
